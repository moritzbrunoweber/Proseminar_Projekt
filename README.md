# Proseminar_Projekt

## Sumary
The GRACE/GRACE-FO satellites, maintained by GravIS, monitor gravitational changes over the entire planet. GravIS provides information about terrestrial water storage anomalies (GravIS TWS Level-3 products), which display water mass anomalies expressed in terms of equivalent water height from all water storage compartments including snow, surface water, soil moisture, and deep groundwater relative to the long term mean period 2002/04 through 2020/03. I want to see, if these changes relate to areas of deforestation in the Amazon rain forest.

## Background and motivation
The Amazon rain forest plays a vital role in the earth's climate system and global water cycle. It acts as a big carbon sink and contributes significantly to regional and global precipitation patterns through evapotranspiration. However, widespread deforestation driven by agriculture, logging, and urbanization threatens the Amazon rain forest. Changes in forest cover can disrupt water storage and availability, affecting surface water, soil moisture, and groundwater dynamics. By analyzing terrestrial water storage anomalies from GRACE/GRACE-FO data in relation to deforestation areas, I want to see the impact deforestation has on the terrestrial water storage, which helps understanding the difficulties we will need to overcome.

## Objective
The result of my project will be a overview of an area in the Amazon rain forest which was subject to deforestation and relate that deforestation to measured changes in terrestrial water storage.

## Implementation
